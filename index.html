                    the most dangerous, but some people say there are more henchworms
                    than pigeons. Luckily for you, they only got a brain capacity to
                    remember one topic of your material.

                A few hundred years ago there was no internet nor computers.
                The only storage for all the information were books and our brains.
                Till today scientist are still researching history and not without reason.
                All religions always said it: “There will come an apocalypse.”
                And it came but … not as expected.
                </br></br>Worms came out of the ground and the whole world began to shake.
                People ran and tried to escape, but no one knew where to go. One strange thing, no one was attacked.
                Groutans (Giant worms) emerged in Egypt and directly went for the Alexandria Library. It were bookworms.
                So much information lost that we as humans lost tons of knowledge including knowledge about geography.
                </br></br>Only you can save the world by outsmarting all Groutans and defeating them with your geography
                knowledge. This apocalyps is a matter of time. Without humans knowledge many living but also unborn creatures will die.
                You must know, it will be a long journey with some struggle along the way.
                Very urgent is not to suffer under those struggles and always aim at another solution.
                Time is ticking my friend.
                </br></br>Do you accept the challenge?

                take down a few of his henchworms who you shouldn't underestimate. For every
                henchworm you defeat a badge will be given to you by the population. After killing
                a Groutan you will take one of his tusks as reward.

                    do less damage which mean you can make more mistakes. Groutans can be

                    Pixel art games are mostly simple to control.
                    Also is the focus of your brain on the moving parts
